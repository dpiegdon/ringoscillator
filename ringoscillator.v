	// One could also use a single LUT for inversion, without the
	// extra delay. But then the oscillator is running at roughly
	// 625MHz and the output signal is so weak that other logic
	// might not properly pick it up. E.g. when connecting an output
	// pin to the signal, the pin has 625MHz with -25dBm, which is
	// 35.56mVpp! So having a single LUT delay line here seems a good
	// choice!
